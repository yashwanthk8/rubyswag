  # The different example contexts that can be used with the DSL include:
  #
  #   * request specs: `describe "..." do ... end`
  #   * controller specs: `describe "..." do ... end`
  #   * integration specs: `describe "..." do ... end`
  #   * model specs: `describe "..." do ... end`
  #   * view specs: `describe "..." do ... end`
